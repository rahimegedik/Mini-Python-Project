# Mini-Python-Project
# Simple Python Projects

This repository contains basic Python projects that I've created while studying. The projects are inspired by both my personal experiences and exercises from the [Code Step By Step](https://www.codestepbystep.com/) website.

## Installation

Most of the projects are standalone. If there are any requirements to run a specific project, it will be mentioned in a separate `README` file inside that project's folder.

## Contributing

If you spot any errors in the projects or have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue or submit a pull request.
